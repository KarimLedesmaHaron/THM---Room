Enter IP:10.10.81.42

<head>
  <title>Hidden Directory</title>
  <link href="stylesheet.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

<body>
  <div class="main">
<h2>Welcome! I have been expecting you!</h2>
<p>To obtain my identity you need to guess my secret! </p>
<!-- It's between 0-99 but I don't think anyone will look here-->

<p>Secret Entered: 73</p>

<p>Urgh, you got it right! But I won't tell you who I am! y2RPJ4QaPF!B</p>
